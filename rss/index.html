<p>The original lines and paths forming the frowning face were created using Adobe Illustrator. For this post, I'm not going to get into how to do so. The internet is your ally.</p>

<p>SVG code exported from Illustrator with some minor edits:  </p>

<p>Using Greensock's TimelineMax class we will create a new timeline instance and manipulate our paths and lines with a sequence of animations. TimelineMax makes it very simple to string several animations together. Our example above has some separate animations that trigger when clicked. We'll go over the initial animation, however, if you'd like to see the code for everything, click on the CodePen tabs above. I highly recommend tinkering around with the code on CodePen to get some practice. Also, check out <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/TimelineMax/">Greensock's</a> documentation for tons of useful tools.</p>

<p>To start, create a new instance of TimelineMax. <br>
<code>const logo = new TimelineMax;</code> <br>
Now we can string any number of animations to this instance and manipulate them as a whole with ease. Let's thoroughly explain one animation and then we can add more from there.  </p>

<pre><code>logo.to('#mouth', 2, { delay: 1, rotation: 270, x: 5, y: -4, transformOrigin: '10px 5px' })  
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>logo</code>: - our instance of TimelineMax</li>
<li><code>.to()</code> - a Greensock method</li>
<li><code>'#mouth'</code> - the id of the element we want to animate</li>
<li><code>2</code> - the duration of this particular animation  </li>
</ul>

<p>Next is an object of optional variables:  </p>

<ul>
<li><code>delay</code> - how long to wait before executing this animation</li>
<li><code>rotation</code> - degrees of rotation</li>
<li><code>x</code> &amp; <code>y</code> - how far to move on the x and y-axis of our SVG</li>
<li><code>transformOrigin</code> - where on our element to initialize these animations. For a rotation, think of this as the pivot point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's see the string of every method for our initial smiley animation:  </p>

<pre><code>logo.to('#mouth', 2, { delay: 1, rotation: 270, x: 5, y: -4, transformOrigin: '10px 5px' })  
      .to('.eyes', 2, { rotation: 90, x: 41, y: -4 }, '-=2')
      .to('#left_ball', 0.75, { opacity: 0, x: 5, y: -45 }, '-=1.15')
      .to('#right_ball', 0.75, { opacity: 0, x: 25, y: -35 }, '-=0.8')
      .to('.face', 3.5, { rotation: 270, ease: Power1.easeInOut }, '-=0.75')
      .to('#left_eye', 2, { x: 1, y: -7 }, '-=2')
      .to('#right_eye', 2, { x: -2, y: -7 }, '-=2')
      .duration(3)
      .eventCallback('onComplete', complete );
</code></pre>

<p>Let's touch on some new items here:  </p>

<ul>
<li><code>'-=2'</code> - the last variable we're passing to some of our tweens. This represents how many seconds to start this animation before the previous animation in the string ends. The default is to wait until the animation prior is complete.</li>
<li><code>'.eyes' &amp; '.face'</code> - groups in our SVG containing several lines &amp; paths that we wish to move together. You can create different groups using a <code>&lt;g&gt; &lt;/g&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><code>ease</code> - this represents the speed with which an animation will begin, progress, and end. Greensock has many options to explore <a href="https://greensock.com/get-started-js#easing">here</a>.</li>
<li><code>.duration(3)</code> - string this on if you want to adjust the total duration of the TimelineMax instance. It will scale the duration of each animation based on the duration you pass to it originally. Pass it the amount seconds you want your animation to take.</li>
<li><code>.eventCallback()</code> - this can take several options, such as,  'onComplete' or 'onStart' as the first argument, and a function to execute as the second argument. In our example, the <code>complete</code> function is executed when the entire string of animations is completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what our file structure will look like:  </p>

<pre><code>|-- src
    |-- actions
        |-- actionCreators.js 
    |-- components
        |-- app.js
    |-- containers
        |-- pictureDisplay.js
    |-- reducers
        |-- index.js
        |-- reducerPictures.js
    |-- index.js
</code></pre>

<p>This structure may seem like overkill for what will be a very simple app, however, it's important to always keep your code modular. This will make your code scalable and much easier to reason through.</p>

<p>We will pass our <code>pictureDisplay.js</code> container to our main component: <code>app.js</code>. This way, if in the future we have more components/containers, we can place them inside the app component, should we so desire.  </p>

<pre><code>components/app.js...  

import React, { Component } from 'react';  
import PictureDisplay from '../containers/pictureDisplay';


export default class App extends Component {  
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;PictureDisplay /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Index.js</code> is where we will create our redux store and render our main app component to the DOM.</p>

<pre><code>index.js...  

import React from 'react';  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';  
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';  
import ReduxPromise from 'redux-promise';

import App from './components/app';  
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(ReduxPromise)(createStore);

ReactDOM.render(  
  &lt;Provider store={createStoreWithMiddleware(rootReducer)}&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/Provider&gt;
  , document.getElementById('root'));
</code></pre>

<p>A lot is happening above so let's list some things out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a redux store  </li>
<li>Apply ReduxPromise middleware which will enable our store/reducers to handle asynchronous API calls  </li>
<li>Pass our store to the Provider and render it to a specified DOM element with our <code>App</code> component</li>
</ul>

<p>Our <code>pictureDisplay</code> container is where we'll interact with our users a little more.</p>

<pre><code>pictureDisplay.js...  

import React, { Component } from 'react';  
import { connect } from 'react-redux';  
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';  
import { fetchPictures } from '../actions/actionCreators';

class PictureDisplay extends Component {  
  componentWillMount() {
    this.props.fetchPictures();
  }

  renderPictures(pictureData) {
    const name = pictureData.picture.name;
    const description = pictureData.picture.description;
    const url = pictureData.picture.url;

    return (
      &lt;tr key={name}
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src={url}&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{description}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    );
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;table&gt;
        {this.props.pictures.map(this.renderPictures)}
      &lt;/table&gt;
    );
  }
}

function mapStateToProps({ pictures }) {  
  return { pictures };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {  
  return bindActionCreators({ fetchPictures }, dispatch);
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(PictureDisplay);
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, let's go over what is happening above. Just before this container is rendered, componentWillMount will be executed. This calls our action creator, <code>fetchPictures</code>. For now just assume it is getting us some random pictures that we want to display. Through our action creator, reducers, and store (all to be explained in depth soon), these pictures are now available in our state. If you look near the bottom of this file, you'll see two functions before we export everything. <code>mapStatetoProps</code> is responsible for making the state/store available to our container. In this case, we are making <code>pictures</code> available. <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> is allowing us to easily dispatch our actions from a component or container that doesn't have direct access to our redux store. We will get deeper into the flow of data once we have gone through the action creators and reducers.</p>

<pre><code>actionCreators.js...  

import axios from 'axios';  
  // axios is a library that will make our API call
const url = 'www.getrandompictures.com';

export const FETCH_PICTURES = 'FETCH_PICTURES';

export function fetchPictures() {  
  const request = axios.get(url);
  return {
    type: FETCH_PICTURES,
    payload: request,
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>fetchPictures</code> is called in our <code>PictureDisplay</code> container, it makes a GET request to the url above. When that request comes back with the pictures, it goes to our reducer (below).</p>

<pre><code>reducerPictures.js...  

import { FETCH_PICTURES } from '../actions/actionCreators';

export default function(state = [], action) {  
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_PICTURES:
      return [action.payload.data, ...state];
  }
  default:
    return state;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because we passed it the type of <code>FETCH_PICTURES</code> when we created it, it will be added to the current state through the reducer with the case of <code>FETCH_PICTURES</code>. If the action type was anything other than <code>FETCH_PICTURES</code>, we would return the state as-is, through the default case.  </p>

<pre><code>reducers/index.js...  

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';  
import PictureReducer from './reducerPictures';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({  
  pictures: PictureReducer,
});

export default rootReducer;
</code></pre>

<p>The above is where, if we had more than one reducer, we would combine them to then pass to our redux store. In this simple example, we are 'combining' just the one reducer to pass to the store.</p>

<h6 id="summary">Summary</h6>

<p>Let's run through the data flow. Our <code>PictureDisplay</code> container calls our <code>fetchPictures</code> action creator. <code>fetchPictures</code> creates an action, <code>FETCH_PICTURES</code>, and makes an API call to GET some random pictures. We are able to make this asynchronous request and process the returned pictures with our ReduxPromise middleware. The returned promise with our picture data is added to the state/redux store in <code>reducerPictures.js</code>. Once added to our store, it is automatically received by our <code>PictureDisplay</code> container through the <code>mapStateToProps</code> function. Once it is received by our container, our other functionality will display the pictures and data to the page.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simple ES6 Features You Should Already Be Using]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Caution: ES6 isn't yet supported by all browsers and will require the use of a compiler, such as <a href="http://babeljs.io/">babel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="modulesimportsexports">Modules: imports/exports</h3>

<p>Writing clean/modular javascript is a must if you ever hope to write code professionally, with any other humans, or even just with your future self. To do so will mean more files that are dry and reusable. ES6 has made exporting and importing simple and flexible enough that there is no excuse for non-modular javascript. Recycle your code!</p>

<p>Exporting several items from one file:  </p>

<pre><code>// someFile.js

export function doThings() {  
  // things being done
};

export var stuff {  
  moreStuff: things,
  otherStuff: words,
};

export function codeAndStuff() {  
  // insert reusable functionality here
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to use those items in another file. We can pick which items individually:  </p>

<pre><code>// someOtherFile.js

import { doThings, stuff } from 'someFile.js';

// use your import:
doThings();  
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say you're bad at coming up with original function names (can you imagine?) and realize that you might confuse your import name with a function already present in that file. The following allows you to make use of an import with any name you specify by using <code>as</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import { doThings as reallyDoThings } from 'someFile.js';

// use your import:
reallyDoThings();  
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps you'd like to import a library that you've installed as a dependency. This will make the entire library available:  </p>

<pre><code>import _ from 'lodash';

_.throttle(...

// OR

import lodash from 'lodash';

lodash.throttle(...  
</code></pre>

<p>If you only need/want to import part of a library:</p>

<pre><code>import { throttle, memoize } from 'lodash';

throttle(...  
memoize(....  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="passingdefaultparametersinsideyourfunctiondefinitionparentheses">Passing default parameters inside your function definition parentheses.</h3>

<p>Do this:  </p>

<pre><code>var defaultsExample = function(chocolate = 'dark', x = 2) {  
  // insert code here
};
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of this:  </p>

<pre><code>var badDefaultsExample = function(chocolate, x) {  
  var chocolate = chocolate || 'dark';
  var x = x || 2;
  // more code here
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know why this will come in handy, other than being shorter, a bug will one day haunt you to demonstrate. With the old syntax a falsy value will cause your var to be set to the default when you least expect it.</p>

<h3 id="arrowfunctions">Arrow Functions.</h3>

<h6 id="forifyouretiredoftypingthewordfunction">For if you're tired of typing the word  <code>function</code>.</h6>

<p><br <br="">

This seems like a good idea for a couple minutes because this strategy has worked many times before, especially with very simple code that likely doesn't resemble real world applications. It becomes a problem when 20 minutes have been wasted guessing and you're no closer to figuring out the problem than when you first noticed it. Enter, the debugger's question.</p>

<p>The debugger's question typically goes something like, "What justified my expectation that <code>blank</code> would do <code>blank</code>." </p>

<p>When you find a bug, you should ask yourself this question and work backwards through your code, step by step, making no assumptions.</p>

<p>Let's walk through a simple code challenge to see how this might work in practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function that, given a string, will return the longest word in the string. If two or more words are tied for the longest word, return the first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's a first attempt:  </p>

<pre><code>var longestWord = function(string) {  
  var array = string.split(' ');
  var longest;
  array.forEach(function(e, i, a) {
    if ( e.length &gt; longest.length ) {
      longest = e;
    }
  });
  return longest;
};
</code></pre>

<p>When passed a sentence, this returns: <code>TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined</code> and points us to <code>longest.length</code>.</p>

<p>Since we are unsure about at what point in the running of our function that this error occurred, it would be wise to see what the value of longest is right before this error occurs. So we'll add <code>console.log(longest);</code> just before our if statement:</p>

<pre><code>var longestWord = function(string) {  
  var array = string.split(' ');
  var longest;
  array.forEach(function(e, i, a) {
    console.log(longest);
    if ( e.length &gt; longest.length ) {
      longest = e;
    }
  });
  return longest;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the same error as above, however, prior to the error, only one value is logged to our console: <code>undefined</code>. This should tell us that during the initial loop of our forEach loop, the value of <code>longest</code> is undefined, hence our error message. </p>

<p>Now let's ask ourselves the debugger's question. What justified our expectation that <code>longest</code> would have a length? This question should take us to whatever the previous step was that involved our variable <code>longest</code>. That happens to be where we initially declared <code>var longest;</code>. Now it should be clear that longest was undefined because we didn't assign it any value when we declared it. </p>

<p>Let's try one more time:</p>

<pre><code>var longestWord = function(string) {  
  var array = string.split(' ');
  var longest = '';
  array.forEach(function(e, i, a) {
    if ( e.length &gt; longest.length ) {
      longest = e;
    }
  });
  return longest;
};
</code></pre>

<p>All that we've changed this time is making <code>longest</code> equal to an empty string when it is declared. This fixes our error and allows our function to run properly.</p>

<p>As you can see, this is a very simple example and serves only to demonstrate how to use the debugger's question. Someone with a little knowledge would likely have spotted the problem right away without needing to go through the code step by step. However, when a code challenge or a real world code problem gets more complex, using this strategy will be a useful habit to have. Used properly, the debugger's question can save a developer valuable time when trying to find a bug in their code. </p>
